# Simple Spam Bot

A Simple and easy way to be the most hated person in your friend group. Just spam the group chat using this bot until you get kicked and you'll be all set!

## How it works

Basically, the bot takes the text you entered in the first input and takes the number you entered in the second input and uses it to know how many times you want to type the text you entered, and then it types it for you. Simple as that!

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and make sure it's added to PATH, Then open the Command Prompt and type this command:

```batch
pip install pyautogui customtkinter
```

That's it. you're done!

    4. press `Start`.
    5. Quickly switch to the window that you want to spam in and click on the input field you want to type messages in.

* Infinite Spam mode:

    This mode will spam the text you entered and it will never stop until you stop it yourself or exit the app. (NOTE: it eats your memory if left on for prolonged periods of time (that applies to most modes tbh), which may result in crashing or some other problems. Be careful!)
