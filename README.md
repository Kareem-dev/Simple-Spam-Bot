# Simple Spam Bot

A Simple and easy way to be the most hated person between your friends, All you have to do is spam the group chat 
using this bot until you get kicked...

## NOTES

This is the first ALpha version of this project, Do not expect it to be polished/fully featured/not buggy, this is
Really buggy and really unstable, But I'm trying to fix as much bugs as I can and I'll be trying to add more features

1. There is a 5 seconds delay after you press the start button before the bot starts working so you gotta be quick, 
There is also a 0.2 seconds delay between every message
I'll make the delays changeable in later versions, the only way to change them at the moment is to open the code yourself
and change them

2. If you opened another window (or the input you were spamming was not pressed) the spamming will stop, basically the bot 
works by typing the text you entered over and over again really quickly, so you'll have to watch the bot until it finishes
spamming (or close the bot)

3. There is a bug that makes the window of the spam bot not responding when it starts spamming which will make it really 
hard to close, but you can close the terminal thats running the bot (the other window that runs when you opened the bot)

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and make sure it's added to PATH
Then open the Command prompt and type this command:
```batch
pip install pyautogui
```

## How to use

1. Open `Main.py` file
2. Type whatever you want to spam
3. Enter how many times do you want to spam
4. press the `Start Spamming` button
5. Quickly switch to the window that you want to spam in and click on the input
6. Wait until the bot finishes spamming
