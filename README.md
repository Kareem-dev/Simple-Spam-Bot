# Simple Spam Bot

A Simple and easy way to be the most hated person between your friends, All you have to do is spam the group chat 
using this bot until you get kicked...

Please don't bully me if my readme and changelog files does not look that professional, that's my first real project.

## NOTES

This is the first ALpha version of this project, Do not expect it to be polished/fully featured/not buggy, this is
Really buggy and really unstable, But I'm trying to fix as much bugs as I can and I'll be trying to add more features

1. There is a 5 seconds delay after you press the start button before the bot starts working so you gotta be quick, 
There is also a 0.2 seconds delay between every message
I'll make the delays changeable in later versions, the only way to change them at the moment is to open the code yourself
and change them

## How it works

Basically, the bot takes the text you entered in the first input and takes the number you entered in the second input and uses it 
to know how many times you want to type the text you entered, and then it types it for you!
Simple as that

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and make sure it's added to PATH
Then open the Command prompt and type this command:
```batch
pip install pyautogui
```
