## [2.1.0] Beta - 2022-7-15

After realizing that this code is utter garbage (pretty expected because this is my first project), I decided to stop wasting the time spent trying to add new stuff and fix this mess. I'll only work on it again if I personally want to add a new feature to annoy my friends or rewrite it again when I become a more experienced programmer.

- Fixed file spam mode
- Start function now stops the threads when it's done
- Fixed a lot of bugs and improved preformance
- I honestly don't remember what new thing I added or fixed in this version other than those, so I think you'll just have to figure it out.
