## [3.5.0]? - 2024/01/31

I think this project has reached its final form. I can update it more and add much more features but it's just not worth it since just looking at this code makes me want to rewrite every single line. I may work on a cli version because only having a gui one is kind of annoying sometimes. If I make one, I'll upload it here.

I've also forgotten everything I've changed during this year... so I'll just make the commit message "minor optimizations."

## [3.0.0] - 2023/01/*

Bacc, I know that I said I won't continue working on this, but I just mainly update the code as some sort of procrastination. And thankfully I'm back with a bunch of fixes and updates this time. Also now that I think about it, those "beta" and "alpha" namings are useless here, it's literally not meant to be a real software with a team working behind it and continuous development, soooo I'll just drop the beta and consider this project fully released from now on.

## [2.1.0] Beta - 2022/07/15

After realizing that this code is utter garbage (pretty expected because this is my first project), I decided to stop wasting the time spent trying to add new stuff and fix this mess. I'll only work on it again if I personally want to add a new feature to annoy my friends or rewrite it again when I become a more experienced programmer.

- Fixed file spam mode
- Start function now stops the threads when it's done
- Fixed a lot of bugs and improved preformance
- I honestly don't remember what new thing I added or fixed in this version other than those, so I think you'll just have to figure it out.
